        What is Micro Sensor?
    </p>

    <b>
        Microsensors are two- and three-dimensional micromachined structures that have smaller size, improved performance, better reliability, and lower production costs than many alternative forms of sensor. They are part of the wider class of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) devices that also includes microactuators.
